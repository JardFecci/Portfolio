Greetings.

My name is Jared Fetcho, and this is a portfolio of some of the projects and code I've worked on
or been involved in during my studies at Penn State University.

These projects involve the languages of HTML, CSS, Java/Javascript, C++, and SQL, and diagrams
for other projects that I have helped in developing that showcase other practical skills as well.

For those who wish to contact me, please do so at jaredfetcho@gmail.com, or call my personal
number at (570) 878-7555.

Thank you for your time and interest! I hope to work with you!
